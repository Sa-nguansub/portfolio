        <il>4 Easy Steps to Satay Perfection!
        <br>
        1. Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, 
            soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry 
            powder, ground coriander, ground ginger, 
            minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in 
            a bowl. 2. Marinate the chicken. Add two 
            pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken 
            breasts to the marinade, toss the chicken in
            the marinade until it’s well coated. Place 
            in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 
            minutes. This chicken is honestly so flavorful
            and tender after just a 30 minute marinade,
            but if you want to make it earlier, you can
            leave the chicken in the marinade for 
            up to 4 hours. 3. Skewer the chicken. 
            If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers
            in water for 30 minutes before preparing
            the skewers. This will prevent the skewers
            from catching fire on the grill, 
            pretty important stuff! Remove the 
            chicken from the marinade and discard
            the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 
            pieces of marinated chicken onto skewers.
            You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked
            wooden skewers. 4. Grill the chicken.
            Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking 
            these skewers quickly over high heat 
            will give them a wonderful sear on the
            outside, while keeping them juicy 
            and tender in the middle! Place the 
            skewers on the grill over high heat for 
            3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an 
            additional 3-4 minutes. Remove from the 
            grill and top with fresh cilantro, if you’d like.

        What should I serve with it?
       <br>       
        Thai Peanut Sauce – while this is optional, it’s 
        also pretty standard to find chicken satay paired
        with peanut sauce. They really are a match made 
        in heaven! Lettuce Leaves – chicken satay is delicious
        served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a fork 
        to remove the chicken from the skewers and place
        it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce
        leaf. Drizzle with a little peanut sauce and 
        you’ve got a light, healthy meal! Fresh Veggies 
        – as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay
        with a fresh veggie tray from Vons and extra Thai
        peanut sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken
        and veggie combo was light, yet still filling 
        enough for a meal and it gave me the opportunity
        to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut
        sauce! Stir Fried Veggies – while the chicken is marinating,
        you can take that time to stir fry up your favorite veggies,
        like broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.
        Asian Salad – for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian
        chopped salad in the produce section at your local
        Vons, to pair with the chicken skewers. Cooked 
        Rice or Quinoa – for a more filling side, serve 
        the chicken satay with a side of cooked white rice, 
        brown rice or quinoa.
